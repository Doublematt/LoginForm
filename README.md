This project is meant to be simple login GUI.
Login forms are everwhere in the internet so It is important to know how to create my own login form and it may be usefull in the future

I am planning to rebuild the GUI to make it looks more fancy (for now its just basic)
Also I am planning to add some register posibility and some after succesful login frame.
